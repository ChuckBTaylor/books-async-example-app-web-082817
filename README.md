# XML HTTP Request
# Breakdown of an XHR Request

## 1. The client sends an XML HTTP request
The client is the browser or whatever is making the request.

## 2. The server composes some type of response
The server composes a response. The response is typically composed of HTML, JSON, XML etc

## 3. The server sends back the response

## 4. The client by default does nothing with our response. Its up to us to programmatically determine how to handle this response
